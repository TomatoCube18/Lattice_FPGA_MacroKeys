## \[ [Chapter 4](#Chapter4): Writing Code & Programming your FPGA ]
### **[4.1](#Chapter4_1) HDL Code Tutorial #1**: Creating your first Lattice Diamond Project
#### [4.1.1](#Chapter4_1_1) Reading Button Input & Driving Simple Output Device [Button & LED]
We'll start our journey with a straightforward Verilog project to ensure that everything is set up and connected correctly up to this point, this includes verifying the software installation, software license, FPGA programming dongle + harness, and lastly the Macro-Keypad FPGA board are all set up correctly. 
If all goes smoothly, the code will make the user LED flash at roughly one-second intervals, and anytime the user press the user button swith, this will cause the LED to stop flashing. 

Below is the schematic for the user LED & Switch which we would be using in our HDL code. One will quickly realize that both peripherals are asserted-low & connected to a unique pin of the FPGA. 

_The LED jumper is shorted by default, thus can be assumed as connected directly to the FPGA. HDL debouncing of the user Switch is not absolutely nescessary for our application & the 0.1ÂµF capacitor should do a good enough job of cleaning up noise from the tactile switch _

![User_LED_Switch](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-01-UserSwitch_LED.png?raw=true)

#### [4.1.2](#Chapter4_1_2) Creating a new Project
Launch the Lattice Diamond Software if it is not already running. Click on the *Project: New* option found in the *Start Page* panel.

![Diamond Main Screen](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-02-Diamond_mainWindow.png?raw=true)

Hit **Next >** in the *New Project* Dialog window.

![Diamond New Project Window](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-03-Diamond_newProject.png?raw=true)

In the second *New Project - Project Name* Dialog window, populate the fields with the following information:
- Project:
    - Name: _Tutorial1_
    - Location: _Folder of your choice, e.g. \<Path\>/tutorials/_

![Diamond Project File Name](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-04-Diamond_FileName.png?raw=true)

Hit **Next >** and since we are not importing any existing source code, we will  Hit **Next >** again.

In the *New Project - Select Device* Dialog window, populate the fields with the following information:
- Select Device:
    - Family: _MachXO2_
    - Device: _LCXO2-1200HC_
    - Package Type: _TQFP100_
    - Performance Grade: _4_
    - Operating Condition: _Commercial_

![Diamond Select FPGA device](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-06-Diamond_SelectDevice.png?raw=true)

Verify the derrived Part number is _LCMXO2-1200HC-4TG100C_ which correspond to the printing on the FPGA on our Macro-KeyPad. Hit **Next >** 

![Diamond Select Synthesis Tool](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-07-Diamond_SynthesisTool.png?raw=true)

Leave the Systhesis Tool as _Lattice LSE_ when prompted by the *New Project - Select Synthesis Tool* Dialog window. Hit **Next >**

![Diamond New Project Summary](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-08-Diamond_ProjectSummary.png?raw=true)

In the final dialog window *New Project - Project Information*, verify that all the information are entered correctly. Hit **Finish** & our new skeleton project is created targetting our exact FPGA.

#### [4.1.3](#Chapter4_1_3) Creating & Editing the Source Code

With the Project created, we are now going to create our Top-level verilog file. Select *[Menu]File > New > File*, Choose _Verilog Files_ as the *Source File* type. 

![Diamond New Verilog File](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-09-Diamond_NewVerilog.png?raw=true)

Give our file the name _LED_, verify the check-box on the _Add to Implementation_ is checked and Hit **New**.

Populate the code editor with the following Top-Level file implementation & hit save.

#### Verilog Top-level file (\*.v):
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
 
module LED (swU,led);
    input wire swU;                        
    output reg led;
   
    reg [31:0]count;
   
    // Internal OSC setting (12.09 MHz)
    OSCH #( .NOM_FREQ("12.09")) IOSC
        (
          .STDBY(1'b0),
          .OSC(clk),
          .SEDSTDBY()
        );
   
    always @(posedge clk or negedge swU) begin
        if (swU == 0) begin
            led <= 1;
        end else if(count == 9999999) begin //Time is up = 9999999/12.09MHz = 0.82s
            count <= 0;             //Reset count register
            led <= ~led;            //Toggle led (in each second)
        end else begin
            count <= count + 1;     //Counts 12.09MHz clock
        end
 
    end
 
endmodule
```

> For all availble output frequency of MachXO2's Internal Oscillator, Please refer to **Table 20.3** in the following Lattice Technical Note: [FPGA-TN-02157](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Relevant_Docs_DataSheets/FPGA-TN-02157-3-0-MachXO2-sysCLOCK-PLL-Design-and-User-Guide.pdf)

#### Logical preference file (\*.lpf):
Open the single file named _Tutorial1.lpf_ under the _LPF Contrained Files_ tree drop-down list, overwrite the file with the content from the following [Predefined board file](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Essential_Files/macrokeys.lpf). 

> To connect our top-level verilog file (consisting of one push-button switch & an LED) to the real world, we would normally go through *"Synthesis"* once & pop into spreadsheet view `([Menu]Tools > Spreadsheet View)` in order to assign each of the input & output bit from the top-level verilog file to a physical pins. But for simplicity sack, we just edited the _Logical preference file (\*.lpf)_ manually. 

![Diamond LPF File](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-11-Diamond_LPF_File.png?raw=true)

#### [4.1.4](#Chapter4_1_4) Synthesis & Generating Configuration Bitstream

Move on over from the *File List* tab to the *Process* tab. Put on check box on both `Place & Route Design > Place & Route Trace` & `Export Files > JEDEC File`. 
Verify all the check-box selection, follow by **Right-Clicking** on **JEDEC File** and choose **Rerun All** from the pop-up menu.

![Diamond Synthesis & Generating](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-12-Diamond_ProcessTab.png?raw=true)

#### [4.1.5](#Chapter4_1_5) Programming/Writing JEDEC file to FPGA's Flash

With the JEDEC File sucessfully generated, it is now time to *Burn* the configuration into the FPGA's Flash memory.

Click on  `([Menu]Tools > Programmer)`, in the *Programmer: Getting Started* dialog window, verify that the correct Cable is selected then Hit *Detect Cable*

> When using the *Deluxe programming Dongle*, always pick *Cable A* when prompted about *Multiple Cable Detected*.

![Diamond Select Programmer](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-12-Diamond_SelectingProgrammer.png?raw=true)

Verify that *Import file to current implementation* is selected, then Hit **OK**.

Once we are back in Diamond's main Window, it will show the programming interface window *after much thinking*, 

> If *Device* (FPGA Chip model) is not detected correctly, manually click the drop-down box & reselect the correct device. And if the programming _JEDEC file_ is not populated, click on the **...** button under the **File Name** column & choose the **.JED** file & Hit **Open**.

![Diamond Burning Program](https://github.com/TomatoCube18/Lattice_FPGA_MacroKeys/blob/main/Images/Chapter04-12-Diamond_JedecProgramming.png?raw=true)

Hit the Green *Program* button in the *Programming window's ToolBar*. 
Observe the Output Log window and check for the message *Info - Operation: sucessful.* 

> Hint: Speed up the programming process? In development phase, it is possible to speed up the programming process by using *Bitstream File* (Instead of JEDEC) & choose Access Mode as _Static RAM Cell Mode_ under the *Operation* configuration.

#### [4.1.6](#Chapter4_1_6) Observing the result on the Macro-KeyPad
After the JEDEC has been programmed into the FPGA, the HDL configuration will take into effect. You will be able to see the user LED flashing periodically & upon pressing on the user Button, the LED will switched off.

Below is the location of the user LED & Switch on the Macro-KeyPad.
